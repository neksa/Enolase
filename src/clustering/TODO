1. Code cleanup
2. Formulate a formal task:
    Concept clustering
    Hierachical (agglomerative) vs non-chierarchical: prefer the latter due to complex relationships between families
    We have agglomerative hierarchical clustering with min-linkage

    Fuzzy clustering: membership probabilities

    Dimensionality reduction
    Unsupervised data reduction: 
        Feature agglomeration
        PCA
        LDA

    Unsupervised clustering:
    Mean-shift: A robust approach toward feature space analysis
    Spectral clustering ?



matches(?) ->  table2 + weights system (1-2-3) -> frequencies of profiles + frequencies of pairs -> clustering

3. Plot: 
(BAD) On a graph in Cytoscape - requires careful manual placement of clusters.
We add pseudonodes as centroids and cluster them, with the distances from centroids to nodes in cytoscape


or on a 2D plane with 2 major components.
Find components via PCA :

mport numpy as np
>>> from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
>>> X = np.array([[-1, -1], [-2, -1], [-3, -2], [1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 2]])
>>> pca = PCA(n_components=2)
>>> pca.fit(X)
PCA(copy=True, n_components=2, whiten=False)
>>> print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_) 
[ 0.99244...  0.00755...]
