There are two profile formats which I use:

 prototype 1 -- is a count matrix of fixed length 50 + additional parameters used to obtain the matrix
 prototype 2 -- is a frequency matrix. each matrix has an ID and number of sequences K. Fixed length 50
 
It would be better to have the header "PROFILE" instead of "PROTOTYPE" in next versions.
The length of profile should be flexible and could be specified explicitly in the header

The file can contain several profiles. No additional header in the file.
To say how many profiles are in the files one need to count profile headers.
